# Using Z Index c

## Problem Statement

When interacting with a site, many times there will be elements that will overlap
each other. There may be a sticky navigation, that floats over the content as you
scroll. When you click on a photo, a modal may pop up with an enlarged version of it.
These are a couple of common examples where you want to control the placement of each
layer on the page. This can be achieved using a property called `z-index`.

## Objectives
1. Explain how to use `z-index` to change the depth of elements

## Conclusion
Changing the `z-index` property of elements allows you to layer different elements
on top of each other. This is commonly used when building out navigations, modals, 
popups/popovers, and other interactive content elements.
